# Project 8

Project 8 involves the development of a movie search app utilizing the OMDb API. This app allows users to search for movies, retrieve details, and interact with the information. The implementation involves designing a custom layout, utilizing Retrofit for API requests, and integrating Glide for image loading.

- Integration with Glide for efficient loading of poster images.
- The ability to open the IMDb page for a selected movie via an implicit         intent.
- A share button that facilitates sharing the movie title and URL using an       implicit intent.
- A feedback button on the toolbar for composing an email addressed to the       developer.

## Extensions

Potential extensions include:
- Display cast info, plot, user reviews
